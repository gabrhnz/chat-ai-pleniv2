# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@example.com (replace with actual email)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Every week until resolved
- **Disclosure**: After patch is available

We aim to:
- Confirm the vulnerability
- Develop and test a fix
- Release a security update
- Credit the reporter (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use different keys for dev/prod

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Use lock files (package-lock.json)
   - Monitor for CVEs

3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries (if using DB)
   - Implement request size limits

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose stack traces in production
   - Log errors securely
   - Return generic error messages to users
   - Monitor error rates

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-IP limits
   - Consider per-user limits
   - Use distributed rate limiting for scale
   - Monitor for abuse patterns

### For Deployments

1. **HTTPS Only**
   - Always use TLS in production
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   - Use HSTS headers
   - Keep certificates updated

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Use secure secret management
   - Don't log sensitive values
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use principle of least privilege

3. **Network Security**
   - Use firewalls
   - Limit open ports
   - Use VPCs in cloud environments
   - Implement DDoS protection

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Monitor API usage patterns
   - Track error rates
   - Log security events

5. **Updates**
   - Keep Node.js updated
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Test updates in staging first
   - Have rollback plan

## Known Security Considerations

### OpenAI API Key Protection

**Risk**: Exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized usage and costs.

**Mitigation**:
- Store in environment variables
- Never commit to version control
- Use different keys per environment
- Monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard
- Set spending limits

### Rate Limiting

**Risk**: API abuse and excessive OpenAI costs.

**Mitigation**:
- IP-based rate limiting implemented
- Consider user-based limits
- Use Redis for distributed limiting
- Monitor and adjust limits

### Input Validation

**Risk**: Malicious input, XSS, injection attacks.

**Mitigation**:
- Express-validator for all inputs
- Sanitization of user messages
- Length limits on all fields
- Content-Type validation

### Error Information Disclosure

**Risk**: Exposing system details in error messages.

**Mitigation**:
- Generic errors in production
- Detailed logs server-side only
- No stack traces to clients
- Separate error handling by environment

## Security Headers

The API implements security headers via Helmet:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

---

## CORS Policy

CORS is configured to:
- Accept requests from allowed origins only
- Support credentials when needed
- Limit allowed methods
- Validate request headers

Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`:
```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
```

---

## Authentication & Authorization

**Current Status**: Not implemented (API is open)

**Future Consideration**: 
- JWT tokens for authentication
- API keys for third-party access
- OAuth2 for delegated access
- Role-based access control

If you need authentication, consider implementing:
```javascript
// Example middleware
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];
  if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);
  
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};
```

## Data Privacy

### User Data
- Messages sent to OpenAI API
- IP addresses for rate limiting
- Optional sessionId and userId

### Data Retention
- No data persisted by default
- Logs rotate automatically
- Consider GDPR if storing user data

### OpenAI Privacy
- Review [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- Be aware data may be used for improvements
- Consider opt-out options for enterprise

## Incident Response Plan

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Assess the scope
   - Contain the breach
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify root cause
   - Determine data exposed
   - Check logs for compromise
   - Document timeline

3. **Remediation**
   - Deploy fixes
   - Rotate compromised credentials
   - Update security controls
   - Notify affected users (if applicable)

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct retrospective
   - Update security measures
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update this policy

---

## Compliance

This API should be evaluated against:

- **GDPR**: If handling EU user data
- **CCPA**: If handling California resident data
- **SOC 2**: If needed for enterprise customers
- **HIPAA**: If handling health data (NOT recommended without proper review)
